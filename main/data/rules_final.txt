GOON SQUAD GALAXY – FINAL RULES

OVERVIEW
In Cosmic Horror in Goon Squad Galaxy, each player commands a squad of GOONs—grotesque monsters, alien machines, and freakish leaders—battling for survival across a ruined cosmos.
 
The key resource is Wind (🌀), which represents fatigue, exposure to cosmic forces, or the strain of action. Wind is tracked physically by rotating each GOON card 90° counterclockwise per Wind it has.
 
At the start of your turn, each GOON card unwinds: rotate 90° clockwise to remove 1 Wind (🌀).
 
When a GOON reaches 4 Wind (🌀🌀🌀🌀), it is destroyed and sent to the discard pile. There are no separate health points—Wind is everything: your cost, your limit, your death.

QUICKSTART
- Each player uses a 60-card deck.
- Your deck includes a Squad Leader, Squad GOONs, and Basic GOONs.
- You lose if your deck runs out or your Squad Leader is destroyed.
- Squad Leader begins in play. Other GOONs must be deployed.
- All characters are GOONs. However, the Squad Leader is not treated as a GOON for targeting unless no other GOONs are in play.

TURN STRUCTURE
1. Draw Phase
- Draw 1 card from your deck.
 
2. Unwind Phase
- Rotate each GOON 90° clockwise to remove 1 Wind.
 
3. Action Phase
- Use any GOON abilities you can pay Wind for.
- Abilities may apply Wind
 
4. Deploy Phase
- Deploy new GOONs from hand by spending Wind.
- GOONs enter play at 0 Wind.
- any goons can contribute wind for deploying new goons
 
5. End Phase
- Resolve any end-of-turn effects.

WIND SYSTEM


All units (GOONs) are destroyed at 🌀4.


Units gain Wind (🌀) when paying to deploy other GOONs or activating abilities.


Wind counts are tracked per GOON.


Wind unwinds at the start of each turn: 🌀🌀🌀 → 🌀🌀 → 🌀 etc.


UNIT TYPES


SL = Squad Leader (1 per deck, always starts in play)


SG = Squad GOON (limit 1 in play at a time)


BG = Basic GOON (unlimited)


Titans = Special units with steep costs, untargetable, immune


DEPLOYMENT RULES


SLs start the game in play with 🌀0.


SGs can only be deployed by SLs.


Any GOON (SL, SG, BG) can pay Wind to summon another GOON.


GOONs enter play with 🌀0 (not stunned or delayed).


WIND SPENDING


Units with 🌀1–3 may spend Wind to take actions.


A unit destroyed by reaching 🌀4 still completes its action.


Units may never exceed 🌀4.


PROTECTION RULES


If any Basic GOON (BG) is in play, Squad Leaders (SLs) cannot be attacked.


If any Squad GOON (SG) is in play, Squad Leaders (SLs) cannot be attacked.


BGs do NOT protect SGs.


Titans never protect or block.


ABILITY LIMITS


A GOON may only activate one ability per turn.


BGs and SGs may have multiple abilities, but may only use one per round.


HAND & DRAW RULES


Players draw 1 card at the start of their turn.


Players lose if they cannot draw a card.


CARD LIMITS


Each deck has 60 cards.


Max 4 copies of any card (except Titans = 1).


SGs are limited to 1 in play per player.


Duplicate SGs drawn while one is in play are kept in hand (not discarded).


TITANS


Cannot be damaged, targeted, stunned, or delayed.


Require specific SL in play to summon.


Do not protect other units or block.


DEATH & DISCARD


Most GOONs that die go to the discard pile (Dead Pool) shared by all players.


Some GOONs, when destroyed, are Retired (removed from the game permanently).


GOONs deployed from the Dead Pool by cards like Technomancer are Retired instead of discarded.


Specific cards (e.g., Kriegsgheist) state they are Retired on destruction and do not return to Dead Pool.


ICONS & CLARIFICATIONS


🌀 = Wind


❌ = Resistance (1 icon = 1 resist)


[d] = Damage (1 icon = 1 damage)


💰 = Wind payment indicator


SLs may spend 💰🌀🌀 to draw 1 card (once per turn, only if at 🌀0)


MISC



All attacks are listed as abilities.


Overwatch and positional rules do not exist.


LOCKED SAFEGUARD:


Squad Leaders may not spend Wind if it would raise them to 🌀4.


Any such action will be blocked and reported before it happens.

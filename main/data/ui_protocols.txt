**GSG UI RENDERING PROTOCOL — FINAL**

---

### SECTION 1: CARD RENDERING RULES

**1.1. Always verify card data against JSON before rendering**

- Load data from final NARC and PCU card JSON files.
- Match cards by exact `name` field.
- Use the following fields:
  - `name`
  - `rank` (BG, SG, SL)
  - `deploy_cost` (array of wind costs, render as ➔ per wind)
  - `image_url_mini` (for field/hand view)
  - `abilities` (include `name` and `cost`)
  - `faction`

**1.2. Card Name Display**

- Display name as **bold text**
- Link only the card name text (not icons) to the full-size image

**1.3. Rank Icons**

- Use no icon for BG
- Use ⬦ (yellow diamond) for SG
- Use ⭐ (yellow star) for SL

**1.4. Deploy Cost**

- Render each wind unit as a single ➔
- Deploy cost appears next to card in hand (e.g., ➔➔➔)

**1.5. Abilities**

- Always list abilities beneath the card name
- Each ability goes on its **own line**
- Format: ➔ [ABILITY NAME] where the number of arrows matches the cost
- Abilities are **clickable** links
  - When clicked, trigger targeting procedure if applicable
  - Disable or hide if used this turn or blocked by effect

**1.6. Wind Status**

- Wind is shown using red bars: ▮ per wind unit
- Maximum: 4 bars (dead)
- Show adjacent to card in field view

**1.7. Mini Image Rendering**

- Always use `image_url_mini` from card JSON
- Align cards side-by-side per faction
- The faction whose turn it is gets second row

**1.8. Squad Leader Deployment**

- SLs are never in hand
- They start the game on field with **0 wind**

**1.9. Squad Goon Uniqueness**

- A player may not deploy a second SG of the **same name** if one is already on field
- Having different SGs (e.g., Vex and Krax) is allowed

**1.10. Retired Cards**

- Cards paid for deploy are **Retired** (removed permanently)
- Dead goons go to **Dead Pool** unless marked "Retired" in their card effect

### SECTION 2: TURN & ACTION FLOW

**2.1. Start of Game**

- Each player begins with their SL in play with 0 wind
- Each player draws 7 cards from their deck (excluding the SL)
- No card limit in hand size

**2.2. Turn Structure**
Turns alternate between players. Each turn follows this structure:

1. **Unwind Phase**
   - All of the active player's goons reduce wind by 1 (if > 0)
   - SLs also unwind unless destroyed or retired

2. **Draw Phase**
   - Draw 1 card (if deck not empty) card must be from card final json file for players faction

3. **Ability Phase**
   - Any goon with a clickable ability may use **1 ability** during this phase
   - Abilities cost wind ➔ icons (spent from that goon unless stated otherwise)
   - unusable abilities are hidden for rest of the turn

4. **Deploy Phase**
   - Deploy any number of goons by spending wind from your field
   - Cannot deploy more than one SG of the same name
   - Wind used for payment is added to the goons who paid it
   - Cards used from the Dead Pool to pay costs are **Retired**

5. **End Phase**
   - Resolve end-of-turn effects
   - No discard — hand size is unlimited

**2.3. Death, Dead Pool, Retirement**

- A goon with 4 wind = dead → move to Dead Pool
- SL with 4 wind = dead → game is lost
- Cards used as payment → **Retired (banished from game)**
- Cards revived from Dead Pool → **Retired** if destroyed
- Cards in the Dead Pool that are used to pay deploy costs are **Retired** — permanently removed from the game (do not return to Dead Pool or discard)

**2.4. Illegal Actions**

- Winding a SL to 4 = immediate loss
- Trying to deploy a duplicate SG = illegal (cancelled)
- Trying to use more than one ability per turn = illegal (ignored)

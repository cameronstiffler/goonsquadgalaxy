GSG UI RENDERING PROTOCOL — FINAL

⸻

SECTION 1: CARD RENDERING RULES

1.1. Always verify card data against JSON before rendering
	•	Load card data from final NARC and PCU card JSON files:
	•	https://cameronstiffler.github.io/goonsquadgalaxy/main/data/narc_final.json
	•	https://cameronstiffler.github.io/goonsquadgalaxy/main/data/pcu_final.json
	•	Match cards by exact name field.
	•	Use the following fields:
	•	name
	•	rank (BG, SG, SL)
	•	deploy_cost (array of wind costs, render as ➔ per wind)
	•	image_url_mini (for field/hand view)
	•	abilities (include name and cost)
	•	icons (mechanical, organic, resist, etc.)
	•	faction
	•	wind (integer, 0–4)
	•	used_ability (boolean)

1.2. Card Name Display
	•	Display card names as bold text
	•	Card names are clickable links to full-size image (if available)

1.3. Rank Icons
	•	No icon = Basic Goon (BG)
	•	🔸 = Squad Goon (SG)
	•	⭐ = Squad Leader (SL)

1.4. Deploy Cost
	•	Show each wind unit as ➔
	•	Deploy cost appears next to card in hand or Dead Pool
	•	Dead Pool cards paid for deploy must also show type (🥩 for organic, ⚙️ for mechanical)

1.5. Abilities
	•	Always list abilities below card name
	•	Format: ➔➔ [ABILITY NAME] (1+ arrows to indicate cost)
	•	Each ability appears on its own line
	•	Abilities are clickable if available this turn
	•	Disabled abilities must be hidden or unclickable

1.6. Wind Status
	•	Wind is shown using red bars: ▮
	•	Maximum wind is 4 = death
	•	Cards start with 0 wind
	•	Place bars beside each card on the field

1.7. Mini Image Rendering
	•	Use image_url_mini from JSON
	•	Align goons side-by-side per faction row

1.8. Squad Leader Deployment
	•	SLs start the game on field with 0 wind
	•	SLs are never in hand
	•	SLs cannot be deployed or redeployed

1.9. Squad Goon Uniqueness
	•	Players may not have more than 1 copy of the same SG in play
	•	Duplicate SGs held in hand are not discarded
	•	Different SGs (e.g., Vex and Krax) may be on field simultaneously

1.10. Retired Cards
	•	Any card used to pay a deploy cost from Dead Pool is Retired (permanently removed)
	•	Goons with “Retired” death effects do not go to the Dead Pool

⸻

SECTION 2: TURN AND ACTION FLOW

⸻

2.0 Deck-Building Phase (before game starts)
	•	Each player builds a deck of 60 cards (not including SL)
	•	Limit 4 copies max of any card
	•	Titan cards are limited to 1 copy total
	•	Only 1 SG of a given name may be in play at a time (per player)
	•	Duplicate SGs drawn while one is on field are kept in hand

⸻

2.1 Start of Game
	•	Load all source files:
	•	https://cameronstiffler.github.io/goonsquadgalaxy/main/data/rules_final.txt
	•	https://cameronstiffler.github.io/goonsquadgalaxy/main/data/ui_protocols.txt
	•	https://cameronstiffler.github.io/goonsquadgalaxy/main/data/narc_final.json
	•	https://cameronstiffler.github.io/goonsquadgalaxy/main/data/pcu_final.json
	•	Each player starts with their SL on field with 0 wind
	•	Each player draws 6 cards from their deck

⸻

2.2 Turn Structure

Each turn alternates between players and follows this order:
	1.	Unwind Phase
	•	All goons on active player’s field reduce wind by 1 (if wind > 0)
	•	SLs unwind as well unless retired
	2.	Draw Phase
	•	Draw 1 card from deck (if not empty)
	•	Drawn cards must match a card from that faction’s official JSON
	3.	Ability Phase
	•	Each goon may use 1 ability per turn
	•	Clickable abilities cost wind (➔ icons)
	•	Once used, ability is marked used_ability: true and disabled
	4.	Deploy Phase
	•	Deploy any number of goons by paying wind from other goons on your field
	•	Paying goons gain wind equal to amount paid
	•	SG deploy rule enforced: Cannot deploy a SG of the same name if already in play
	•	Cards used from the Dead Pool to pay deploy costs are Retired
	5.	End Phase
	•	Resolve lingering effects
	•	Hand size is unlimited (no discards)

⸻

2.3 Death, Dead Pool, Retirement
	•	A goon with 4 wind is dead → sent to Dead Pool
	•	SL with 4 wind = instant game loss
	•	Cards paid from field = stay in game (wind added to paying goons)
	•	Cards paid from Dead Pool = Retired
	•	If a revived goon dies again = Retired
	•	Retired goons do not return to Dead Pool or deck

⸻

2.4 Illegal Actions
	•	Attempting to deploy a duplicate SG → invalid (cancelled)
	•	Winding SL to 4 → game over
	•	Using >1 ability per goon per turn → invalid
	•	Invalid ability use → ignored

⸻

SECTION 3: FIELD & HAND DISPLAY

3.1 Field Layout
	•	Two horizontal rows:
	•	Top = Opponent (non-active)
	•	Bottom = Active player

	•	Mini image
	•	Bold name (clickable)
	•	Rank icon (⭐/🔸/none)
	•	Wind bars (▮)
	•	Abilities (➔➔ NAME), one per line

3.2 Hand Layout
	•	Hand shown below field (active player only)
	•	Each card includes:
	•	Mini image
	•	Bold name
	•	Rank icon
	•	Deploy cost: ➔ symbols
	•	Icons (if present):
	•	⚙️ = mechanical
	•	🥩 = organic
	•	🔹 = resist

3.3 Ability Interaction
	•	Click = trigger targeting
	•	Once used, mark as used_ability: true
	•	Ability becomes inactive until next turn
